  current drive estimate:
    # used for estimation of the trapped particle fraction
    # epsilon fraction of 0.5 means
    # the neoclassical trapped particle ε is (0.5 a)/R
    ε fraction: {value: 0.5, reference: Menard T29}

    # This fudge factor may be to better align calculations
    # with literature values.
    # Menard's is 0.7; I've adjusted mine so that
    # the overall current drive efficiency is the same.
