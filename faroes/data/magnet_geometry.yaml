external structure thickness : {value: 5, units: cm} # corresponds to A_t thickness
ground wrap thickness : {value: 4, units: mm} # goes around the winding pack, on both inboard and outboard sides
inter-block clearance : {value: 2, units: mm} # between winding packs and structural blocks

winding pack:
  f_HTS : 0.76 # fraction of winding pack area which is HTS cable
