Running tests

After installation, it's important to make sure that FAROES is working as intended.
FAROES uses the ``python`` module ``unittest``.

To run the tests, ``cd`` to the ``FAROES/faroes`` folder and run ``python -m unittest``.
You should see a bunch of dots appear on the terminal, some other outputs, and finally the message
``Ran x tests in y s. OK``.

If you get an error that means something's not working. In this case, contact the developers.
