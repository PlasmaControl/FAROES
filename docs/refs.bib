  abstract = {A heuristic model for the plasma scrape-off width in low-gas-puff tokamak H-mode plasmas is introduced. Grad B and curv B drifts into the scrape-off layer (SOL) are balanced against near-sonic parallel flows out of the SOL, to the divertor plates. The overall particle flow pattern posited is a modification for open field lines of Pfirsch-Schl\"uter flows to include order-unity sinks to the divertors. These assumptions result in an estimated SOL width of {$\sim$}2a{$\rho$} p/R. They also result in a first-principles calculation of the particle confinement time of H-mode plasmas, qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. It is next assumed that anomalous perpendicular electron thermal diffusivity is the dominant source of heat flux across the separatrix, investing the SOL width, derived above, with heat from the main plasma. The separatrix temperature is calculated based on a two-point model balancing power input to the SOL with Spitzer-H\"arm parallel thermal conduction losses to the divertor. This results in a heuristic closed-form prediction for the power scrape-off width that is in reasonable quantitative agreement both in absolute magnitude and in scaling with recent experimental data. Further work should include full numerical calculations, including all magnetic and electric drifts, as well as more thorough comparison with experimental data. \textcopyright{} 2012 IAEA, Vienna.},

PROCESS is usually used in optimisation mode, in which it finds a set of parameters that maximise (or minimise) a figure of merit chosen by the user, while being consistent with the inputs and the specified constraints. Because the user can apply all the physically relevant constraints, while allowing a large number of parameters to vary, it is in principle only necessary to run the code once to produce a self-consistent, physically plausible reactor model. The scope of PROCESS is very wide and goes well beyond reactor physics, including conversion of heat to electricity, buildings, and costs, but this paper describes only the plasma physics and magnetic field calculations.},

The narrow SOL heat channel causes the high steady-state heat flux to the divertor plate. In addition to the large electron conductive heat flux, the large ion convective heat flux due to enhanced SOL flow can bring the narrow heat channel. Neoclassical SOL flow acceleration mechanism may be a cause of the high SOL flow speed. A tokamak plasma with strongly negative triangularity may have reduced SOL flow acceleration due to trapped particles. Furthermore the negative-triangularity configuration can have larger power handling area at the low-field-side torus, and is a possible scenario of tokamak reactor.},

  abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) induced energetic ion loss in neutral beam heated H-mode discharges in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is discussed. After H-mode onset, the neutral particle analyser (NPA) spectrum usually exhibits a significant loss of energetic ions mainly for E {$>$} Eb/2 where Eb is the beam injection energy, although this loss occasionally extends to lower energy. The magnitude of the energetic ion loss diminishes with increasing tangency radius of the NPA sightline, increasing the toroidal field and the neutral beam injection energy. Modelling suggests that MHD-induced ion loss is enhanced during H-mode operation due to an evolution of the q and beam deposition profiles that feeds both passing and trapped ions into the region of the plasma affected by the low-n MHD activity. It must be emphasized that this loss mechanism is a pressure profile effect that can sometimes occur in unusually high density L-mode discharges, but almost always is observed in H-mode discharges because of the intrinsic broad electron density profile. Analysis of the particle interaction with a model magnetic perturbation supports the energy selectivity of the observed MHD-induced loss. Transport analysis using a fast-ion diffusion model to emulate MHD-induced energetic ion loss shows significant modifications of the heating produced by the neutral beam which changes the inferred power balance, thermal diffusivities and the thermal energy confinement time. In the case cited herein, MHD-induced energetic ion loss increased the thermal energy confinement, {$\tau$}E, by {$\sim$}15\% and reduced the toroidal beta, {$\beta$}T, by {$\sim$}7\%. An accounting of energetic ion loss is therefore important for proper analysis of power balance and transport in plasmas exhibiting MHD-induced energetic ion loss.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a DEMO divertor segmentation and maintenance scheme together with maintenance time estimations. As far as it is known, it is the first such study for DEMO, and the work was coordinated by EFDA. The approach of the study was that DEMO divertor and its handling shall be very similar to that of ITER, therefore ITER divertor segmentation and maintenance schemes were used as starting point. The maintenance scheme for both ITER and DEMO is the following: the divertor is segmented into cassettes. For maintenance 3 divertor ports are used through which all equipment and cassettes are inserted and removed. A toroidal rail based machine transports the element toroidally in front of the port, from where a radial tractor is used that move it between cask and VV. The main difference between DEMO and ITER is the increase in major radius from 6.2 to 7.5 m, and the cassette segmentation changed from 6.66{$\smwhtcircle$} to 11.25{$\smwhtcircle$}. These two factors increase the cassette weight from 12 to 25 tons. Therefore the cantilevered radial transportation of ITER cassettes was not adapted, but instead, the first design of a new, bottom supported radial machine is proposed. For the entire blanket maintenance 70 days were calculated instead of the 179 days in ITER. It was also concluded, that if in-vessel toroidal machine is used for blanket maintenance, there are no real possibilities for parallel blanket/divertor replacement.},

Notably, the construction of ITER is providing important benchmark numbers for technologies and costs. In addition, we use a more conservative neutron wall flux and fluence. But, these cost-increasing factors are offset by greater optimism on the thermal-electric conversion efficiency and potential availability. In addition, today's inflation and interest rates are low, leading to a cost of money well below that used in the original study. The main examples show the cost of electricity (COE) as a function of aspect ratio and neutron flux to the first wall. The dependence of the COE on availability, thermoelectric efficiency, electrical power output, and the present day's low interest rates is also discussed. Interestingly, at fixed aspect ratio there is a shallow minimum in the COE at neutron flux of ϳ2.5 MW/m2. The possibility of operating with only a small COE penalty at even lower wall loadings (to 1.0 MW/m2 at larger plant size) and the possible use of niobium-titanium coils are also investigated. It should be emphasized that the variation in the COEs is important rather than their absolute values.},

  abstract = {On the basis of an analysis of the ITER L-mode energy confinement database, two new scaling expressions for tokamak L-mode energy confinement are proposed, namely a power law scaling and an offset-linear scaling. The analysis indicates that the present multiplicity of scaling expressions for the energy confinement time τE in tokamaks (Goldston, Kaye, Odajima-Shimomura, Rebut-Lallia, etc.) is due both to the lack of variation of a key parameter combination in the database, fs = 0.32 R a−0.75 k0.5 ∼ A a0.25k0.5, and to variations in the dependence of τE on the physical parameters among the different tokamaks in the database. By combining multiples of fs and another factor, fq = 1.56 a2 kB/RIp = qeng/3.2, which partially reflects the tokamak to tokamak variation of the dependence of τE on q and therefore implicitly the dependence of τE on Ip and ne, the two proposed confinement scaling expressions can be transformed to forms very close to most of the common scaling expressions. To reduce the multiplicity of the scalings for energy confinement, the database must be improved by adding new data with significant variations in fs, and the physical reasons for the tokamak to tokamak variation of some of the dependences of the energy confinement time on tokamak parameters must be clarified.}

Amongst the proposed improvements, the area of power exhaust plays a crucial role since predictive capability of present-day models is low and this area is expected to play a major role in limiting DEMO designs due to the much larger value of Ptot/R in DEMO than in present-day devices and even ITER. \textcopyright{} 2013 IAEA, Vienna.},
