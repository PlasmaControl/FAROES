Radiation
=========
Radiation is important for power balance in fusion devices. There are three main categories of radiation in tokamaks; Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron (also called electron cyclotron or EC), and impurity radiation.

.. toctree:: Bremsstrahlung <bremsstrahlung>
   :maxdepth: 1

.. toctree:: Synchrotron <synchrotron>
   :maxdepth: 1

* Impurity radiation: not yet implemented.
